Autism is much more common than many people think:

- **1/100** people have ASD from all backgrounds worldwide
- **1/57** children (1.76%) in the UK are on the autistic spectrum
- **60,000** autistic people living in the West Midlands

### The workplace

People with autism struggle to stay at jobs much more than many believe:

- In the UK, only **22%** of autistic adults in any kind of employment and only **16%** are in full-time employment 
- Only just over **1 in 5** autistic adults are in work, despite research showing the vast majority want to work. 
- Half of managers are uncomfortable employing a neurodivergent worker.

### Demographic differences

Autism diagnoses are also not spread equally across different demographics. In the UK, children diagnosed with autism were:

- **2.1%** black children
- **0.85%** roma/irish children
- **80%** male

while in the USA,

- **13.2/1000** white children are diagnosed with autism
- **11.1/1000** black children
- **8/1000** hispanic children
- African-american children are **5.1x** more likely to be misdiagnosed

### Education

There is also a correlation between level of education and autism diagnoses:

- Children of mothers educated to A-levels or above had **more than twice the rate** of autism diagnosis, at **1.5%** compared to **0.7%**
- **60%** of autistic children are more likely to be socially disadvantaged, although no significant correlation can be seen when controlling for mother's education status
