Autism is much more common than many people think:

- **1/100** people have ASD from all backgrounds worldwide
- **1/57** children (1.76%) in the UK are on the autistic spectrum
- **60,000** autistic people living in the West Midlands

Furthermore, people with high-functioning autism struggle to stay at jobs much more than many believe:

- In the UK, only **22%** of autistic adults in any kind of employment and only **16%** are in full-time employment 
- Only just over **1 in 5** autistic adults are in work, despite research showing the vast majority want to work. 
- Half of managers are uncomfortable employing a neurodivergent worker.

Autism diagnoses are also not spread equally across different demographics. In the UK, children diagnosed with autism were:

- **2.1%** black children
- **0.85%** roma/irish children
- **60%** more likely to be socially disadvantaged
- **80%** male
