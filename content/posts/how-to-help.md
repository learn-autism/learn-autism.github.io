Autism is not an illness or disease, nor is it the same for everyone on the spectrum. It affects how people interact with the world as if they are seeing it from a different angle. Autistic people may need extra support in certain areas so here are a few ways you can help:
1. Be wary of the aims and programmes of autism charities you support - training autistic people to act neurotypically is not ok!
2. Some good charities to support: 
- [National Autistic Society](https://www.autism.org.uk/)
- [Autism West Midlands](https://autismwestmidlands.org.uk/)
- [Autism Research Trust](https://autismresearchtrust.charity/)
- [Ambitious about Autism](https://www.ambitiousaboutautism.org.uk/)
3. Make a conscious effort to be kind and understanding of all people in your day to day life
4. Don’t leap to conclusions or make assumptions about autistic people or say things like “You don’t look autistic” - there’s not a way to look autistic
5. Take time to learn about autism from actual autistic people rather than believing stereotypes
6. Follow our [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/learn.autism/) and [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/@learn.autism) **@learn.autism** where we strive to spread awareness and acceptance of autism in our community
