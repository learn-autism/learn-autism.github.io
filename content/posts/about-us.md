## Who we are

We are a group of 15 young people who's aim is to raise awareness on the daily life of young people with autism.
We are organising a social media campaign, along with street interviews.

## What we are doing

We are running a multi-part campaign, involving three main parts:

- This website, where people can read more about autism
- Social media accounts where we will be raising awareness on the day to day life of young people with autism
- Street interviews, where we will be providing a VR experience to experience what living with autism can be like
